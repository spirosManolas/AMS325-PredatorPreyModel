# AMS325-PredatorPreyModel
# This work is done as a part of Stony Brook Univerisyt AMS 325 under professor Dr. Ryan Kaufmann

# This repository contains our (Spiros Manolas & Leah Walker) code for our AMS 325 final project, focused on exploring Predator Prey Models

# This project focuses on using the Lotka-Volterra Equations to model predator-prey relationship
# We begin with a simple one predtor, one prey example, and explore more complex configurations, with and without carrying capacities
